<h1>Reading Quiz: Submission Results</h1>
<p>Here is what you have submitted for your reading quiz. Please keep a copy of this page for your records.</p>
<pre>Reading quiz number: 6
Student number: 1000357071
1. <p>A function takes two bool values and returns an int. What is the type contract for this function?</p>

The contract type is ''' (bool, bool) -&gt; int '''
2. <p>For the <code>is_even</code> function, give one more example you might add to the docstring as part of step 5 of the design recipe. Try to think of a new kind of test (but do not use something like <code>2.5</code> because that violates the type contract!).</p>
is_even(8)
True

is_even(1999)
False
3. <p>What did you find particularly difficult or confusing about the material you read? If nothing was difficult or confusing, tell us what you found most interesting. Please be as specific as possible: this is meant to help you focus on problematic areas, as well as help me make more meaningful lectures.</p>
I did not find anything difficult about this part of the reading. The fact that I found interesting was the use of functions. Functions make everything look easier and neat in the program. It organizes the code very effectively.
