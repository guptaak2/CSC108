<h1>Reading Quiz: Submission Results</h1>
<p>Here is what you have submitted for your reading quiz. Please keep a copy of this page for your records.</p>
<pre>Reading quiz number: 17
Student number: 1000357071
1. <p>Assume that you are reading integers from a file. Why is it necessary to use <code>int</code> to convert the lines to integers?</p>

Because the readfile method only reads strings, therefore, to read integers, we need to convert it. Ex: value = float(line).


2. <p>When printing a file to the screen, why do the lines get double-spaced?</p>
Lines get double-spaced because the print command prints a new line character. 
3. <p>What did you find particularly difficult or confusing about the material you read? If nothing was difficult or confusing, tell us what you found most interesting. Please be as specific as possible: this is meant to help you focus on problematic areas, as well as help me make more meaningful lectures.</p>
Please go over in more detail :).
