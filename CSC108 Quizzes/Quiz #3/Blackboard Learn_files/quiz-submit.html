<h1>Reading Quiz: Submission Results</h1>
<p>Here is what you have submitted for your reading quiz. Please keep a copy of this page for your records.</p>
<pre>Reading quiz number: 3
Student number: 1000357071
1. <p>What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?</p>

A parameter is a something that is received and an argument is something that is sent. Arguments are supplied when a function is called, and parameters are received by the called function.
2. <p>Consider the following interaction at the Python shell:</p><pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; def return_something ():
...   return "Hi!"
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>Is this an example of a function definition or a function call? If I wanted to display the message <code>Hi!</code> using the function, what would I next type at the shell?</p>

This is an example of a function definition. 
In order to display the message Hi! using the function, we need to type
print (return_something()) into the python shell.

3. <p>What did you find particularly difficult or confusing about the material you read? If nothing was difficult or confusing, tell us what you found most interesting. Please be as specific as possible: this is meant to help you focus on problematic areas, as well as help me make more meaningful lectures.</p>
The difficult part about this reading was answering Question #2 in this quiz. The program is not complete as there is not variable defined to store the return variable i.e. there are no parameters. That was the only part that was confusing for me.
