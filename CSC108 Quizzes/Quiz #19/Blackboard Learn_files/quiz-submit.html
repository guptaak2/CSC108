1. <p>Write a function that takes a dictionary and produces output, as follows (the function does not return anything). The function should produce, according to the sorted order of the keys, every other key. For example, for the dictionary <code>{'c':3, 'b':2, 'a':1, 'd':4, 'e':5}</code>, your function should print:
</p><pre>a
c
e
</pre>

def dictionary_function (dictionary):
     ''' (dictionary) -&gt; NoneType'''
     sort_dictionary = dictionary.sort()
     index = 0
     for element in dictionary:
          index = index[element]
          return index % 2 == 0

2. <p>What did you find particularly difficult or confusing about the material you read? If nothing was difficult or confusing, tell us what you found most interesting. Please be as specific as possible: this is meant to help you focus on problematic areas, as well as help me make more meaningful lectures.</p>
Just go over in detail :)
