1. <p>On Friday, we're going to study bubble sort. Unlike insertion sort and selection sort, the unsorted part is at the left of the list and the sorted part is at the right. Each pass of bubble sort works like this: for each index in the unsorted part, compare the value to the value to its right. If the elements are out of order, swap them.</p>

<p>For the list <code>8 10 3 5 1</code>, what is the list after one pass of bubble sort?</p>

8 10 3 5 1
