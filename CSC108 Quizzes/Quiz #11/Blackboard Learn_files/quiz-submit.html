<h1>Reading Quiz: Submission Results</h1>
<p>Here is what you have submitted for your reading quiz. Please keep a copy of this page for your records.</p>
<pre>Reading quiz number: 11
Student number: 1000357071
1. <p>What is wrong with the following attempt at string formatting? (Type it at the Python shell to see the error message!)</p>
<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; 'The magic word is {1}'.format('xyzzy')
</pre>

the error is IndexError: tuple index out of range. 
2. <p>What is the value of <code>ord('c') - ord('a')</code>? <code>ord('d') - ord('b')</code>? What do you notice and why? Try <code>ord('f') - ord('c')</code>.</p>
ord('c') - ord('a') = 2
ord('d) - ord('b') = 2
It subtracts the position of the letters.
ord('f') - ord('c') = 3
3. <p>What did you find particularly difficult or confusing about the material you read? If nothing was difficult or confusing, tell us what you found most interesting. Please be as specific as possible: this is meant to help you focus on problematic areas, as well as help me make more meaningful lectures.</p>
I did not quite understand the string formatting techniques fully.
