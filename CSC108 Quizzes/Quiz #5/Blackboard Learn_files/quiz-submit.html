<h1>Reading Quiz: Submission Results</h1>
<p>Here is what you have submitted for your reading quiz. Please keep a copy of this page for your records.</p>
<pre>Reading quiz number: 5
Student number: 1000357071
1. <p>Consider this code:
</p><pre>import math

print ("The area of circle with radius 5 is ", math.pi * 5 ** 2)
print ("The area of circle with radius 8 is ", math.pi * 8 ** 2)
print ("The area of circle with radius 2 is ", math.pi * 2 ** 2)
</pre>

<p>Eliminate the duplication in this code by defining an <code>area</code> function and calling it three times. Your program should produce the same output as mine. Please paste your code below.</p>

def area (radius) :
      area = math.pi * radius ** 2
      return area

area (5)
area (8)
area (2)
      
2. <p>Rewrite this code from the How To so that the function body contains only one statement (i.e. so that there is a <code>def</code> line and then only a <code>return</code>). (Note that I've changed the variable names to use <code>this_style</code> rather than <code>thisStyle</code> used in the book. We will not use any uppercase letters in our variable and function names in this course, and will use underscores to separate words.)</p><pre>def pyramid_volume(height, base_length) : 
  base_area = base_length * base_length
  return height * base_area / 3
</pre>

def pyramid_volume (height, base_length) :
      return height * (base_length * base_length) / 3
3. <p>What did you find particularly difficult or confusing about the material you read? If nothing was difficult or confusing, tell us what you found most interesting. Please be as specific as possible: this is meant to help you focus on problematic areas, as well as help me make more meaningful lectures.</p>
I did not find anything difficult in this reading section. The fact that I found interesting was that functions are so useful in day-to-day calculations and can be applied to any field of study. The other fact that I found interesting is that functions in Python are way easier than Java.
