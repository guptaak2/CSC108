<h1>Reading Quiz: Submission Results</h1>
<p>Here is what you have submitted for your reading quiz. Please keep a copy of this page for your records.</p>
<pre>Reading quiz number: 7
Student number: 1000357071
1. <p>Here is part of the code from How To 5.1 (I have changed the variable names to use underscores rather than capital letters):
</p><pre>if original_price &lt; 128 : 
  discount_rate = 0.92 
else : 
  discount_rate = 0.84 
discounted_price = discount_rate * original_price
</pre>
If <code>original_price</code> is 50, what will be the value of <code>discounted_price</code>?<p></p>

discounted_price = 0.92 x 50 = 46.
2. <p>What is the output produced by the following code?</p><pre>x = 5
if x &gt;= 3:
  print('one')
elif x &gt; 2:
  print('two')
else:
  print('three')
</pre>

one
3. <p>What did you find particularly difficult or confusing about the material you read? If nothing was difficult or confusing, tell us what you found most interesting. Please be as specific as possible: this is meant to help you focus on problematic areas, as well as help me make more meaningful lectures.</p>
I did not find anything particularly difficult or confusing about the material to be read. The fact that I found interesting was the use of "elif" rather than multiple if and else statements.
