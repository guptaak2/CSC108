<h1>Reading Quiz: Submission Results</h1>
<p>Here is what you have submitted for your reading quiz. Please keep a copy of this page for your records.</p>
<pre>Reading quiz number: 16
Student number: 1000357071
1. <p>At the start of Section 6.7.1, there is a two-dimensional list called <code>counts</code>. What is <code>len(counts)</code>? What is <code>len(counts[0])</code>?</p>

len(counts) = 
len(counts[0]) = 3
2. <p>Write the body for the following function. This question has nothing to do with lists, but (as in week 3) I want to give you a chance to assess your understanding. You should be able to answer a question like this at this point in the semester. The question should not be too difficult: if you have great trouble getting started or solving the question, now is the time to talk to me. Thanks!</p>
<pre>def count_digits(s):
    ''' (str) -&gt; int
    Return the number of characters of s that are digits.
    &gt;&gt;&gt; count_digits('xx3ab438k9')
    5
    '''
</pre>

<p>Paste your code below:</p>

def count_digits (s):
     count = 0
     for digit in s:
           if digit.isdigit():
               count +=1
     return count

3. <p>What did you find particularly difficult or confusing about the material you read? If nothing was difficult or confusing, tell us what you found most interesting. Please be as specific as possible: this is meant to help you focus on problematic areas, as well as help me make more meaningful lectures. Happy thanksgiving!</p>
Nothing was difficult or confusing. I just needed some practice for this question. By the way, this is really great way to keep track of every student's progress.
