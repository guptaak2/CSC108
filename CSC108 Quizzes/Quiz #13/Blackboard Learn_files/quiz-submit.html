<h1>Reading Quiz: Submission Results</h1>
<p>Here is what you have submitted for your reading quiz. Please keep a copy of this page for your records.</p>
<pre>Reading quiz number: 13
Student number: 1000357071
1. <p>On the first page of section 4.6, a for-loop and equivalent while-loop are given. They have exactly the same result. Which one do you prefer. Why?</p>

I prefer the for loop because it is easier to read and understand. It also uses fewer lines of code than the while loop. 
2. <p>Section 4.6 also describes a type of for-loop using <code>range</code>. Use a range-for-loop to write a loop that prints the numbers from 4 to 8.</p>
for i in range (4,9)
   print (i)
3. <p>What did you find particularly difficult or confusing about the material you read? If nothing was difficult or confusing, tell us what you found most interesting. Please be as specific as possible: this is meant to help you focus on problematic areas, as well as help me make more meaningful lectures.</p>
I didn't find it confusing but it wasn't easy to understand either. Could you please go over for and while loops in detail in the lecture. Thankyou.
