Sorry prof I don't have time to do the readings.
3. <p>What did you find particularly difficult or confusing about the material you read? If nothing was difficult or confusing, tell us what you found most interesting. Please be as specific as possible: this is meant to help you focus on problematic areas, as well as help me make more meaningful lectures.</p>
