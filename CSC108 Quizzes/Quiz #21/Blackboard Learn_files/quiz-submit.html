1. <p>On page 3 of the <a href="https://cs.utm.utoronto.ca/~zingarod/108/lecture20/birthday.pdf">Birthday Exercises</a> is a function <code>invert_bdm</code>. It takes a birthday month dictionary and returns a birthday dictionary (both of these are described in the handout).</p>

<p>Please work on writing <code>invert_bdm</code> and paste me your code.</p>

I have no idea what I should do for this function. I don't understand dictionaries thoroughly.
