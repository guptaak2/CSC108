1. <p>What are the two major differences between lists and strings?</p>

Lists can hold values of any type
Strings are sequences of characters.
Lists are mutable
Strings are immutable.
2. <p>What is the difference between the <code>index</code> method and the <code>in</code> operator? Experiment with these and include in your answer some examples that demonstrate the difference.</p>
The in operator tests whether an element is contained in a list.
The index method returns the position of the given element in the list.
3. <p>What did you find particularly difficult or confusing about the material you read? If nothing was difficult or confusing, tell us what you found most interesting. Please be as specific as possible: this is meant to help you focus on problematic areas, as well as help me make more meaningful lectures.</p>
I did not find anything particularly difficult or confusing. Could you just go over the lists and its methods in a little more detail.
