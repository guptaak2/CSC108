<h1>Reading Quiz: Submission Results</h1>
<p>Here is what you have submitted for your reading quiz. Please keep a copy of this page for your records.</p>
<pre>Reading quiz number: 12
Student number: 1000357071
1. <p>In table 1 (while Loop Examples), look at the first loop example. How many times does that loop run?</p>

The loop runs 14 times.
2. <p>What is the problem in the following code?</p><pre>x = 5
y = 10
while x &gt; 1:
  y -= 1
</pre>

This is an infinite loop as x is always 5 and 5 is always greater than 1.

3. <p>What did you find particularly difficult or confusing about the material you read? If nothing was difficult or confusing, tell us what you found most interesting. Please be as specific as possible: this is meant to help you focus on problematic areas, as well as help me make more meaningful lectures.</p>
Nothing, I really liked this section :)
