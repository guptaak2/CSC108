<h1>Reading Quiz: Submission Results</h1>
<p>Here is what you have submitted for your reading quiz. Please keep a copy of this page for your records.</p>
<pre>Reading quiz number: 8
Student number: 1000357071
1. <p>Using a logical operator, rewrite this if-statement so that it takes fewer lines of code.</p>
<pre>if x &lt; 3:
  print("hi")
elif x &gt; 5:
  print("hi")
</pre>

if x &lt; 3 or x &gt; 5:
  print ( "hi" )


2. <p>In the expression <code>A or B</code>, assume <code>A</code> is false. Is it necessary to evaluate <code>B</code>, or can Python use short-circuit evaluation and determine the value of the expression using <b>only</b> <code>A</code>? Explain.</p>
No, python cannot use short-circuit evaluation and determine the value of the expression using A because assuming that A is false, but if B is True, then the expression evaluates True. But, if B is false, then the expression evaluates False.
Therefore, python has to determine the value of B in order to compute the expression. 
3. <p>What did you find particularly difficult or confusing about the material you read? If nothing was difficult or confusing, tell us what you found most interesting. Please be as specific as possible: this is meant to help you focus on problematic areas, as well as help me make more meaningful lectures.</p>
I did not find anything particularly difficult about this reading. The fact that I found interesting was the "short-circuit evaluation" that takes the fastest path to compute an expression. I also found the "De Morgan's Law" extremely interesting as it can be used to simplify large expressions. not (A and B) = not A or not B, not (A or B) = not A and not B.
