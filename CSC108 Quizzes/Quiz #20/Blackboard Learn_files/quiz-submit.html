1. <p>What is the type of the dictionary created in phase 1 of the Lazy Literature example? i.e. it is a <code>dict of {...:...}</code>; what is the type of the keys and what is the type of the values?.</p>

(string, int)
2. <p>Reconsider the text <code>Did you get the sword from the old man on top of the waterfall?</code>. Imagine we start generating our story from the word <code>from</code> rather than the empty string. If we generate text of three words, what are the three possible texts we could generate?</p>
I don't know how to answer the question. 
3. <p>What did you find particularly difficult or confusing about the material you read? If nothing was difficult or confusing, tell us what you found most interesting. Please be as specific as possible: this is meant to help you focus on problematic areas, as well as help me make more meaningful lectures.</p>
Please go over in detail.
