<h1>Reading Quiz: Submission Results</h1>
<p>Here is what you have submitted for your reading quiz. Please keep a copy of this page for your records.</p>
<pre>Reading quiz number: 15
Student number: 1000357071
1. <p>Assume <code>a</code> refers to a list. What is the difference between <code>b = a</code> and <code>b = list(a)</code>? Include some relevant examples in your response.</p>

b = a assigns the list a to a variable b.
b = list(a) copies the elements in a to b.
2. <p>In section 6.4, there is a function <code>multiply</code>. Why doesn't that function have or require a <code>return</code> statement?</p>
The function does not require a return statement because it multiplies all the elements of the list by a factor and replaces the original list with the "multiplied by 10" list.

3. <p>What did you find particularly difficult or confusing about the material you read? If nothing was difficult or confusing, tell us what you found most interesting. Please be as specific as possible: this is meant to help you focus on problematic areas, as well as help me make more meaningful lectures.</p>
Could you go over this a little bit more in detail. Thankyou.
