<h1>Reading Quiz: Submission Results</h1>
<p>Here is what you have submitted for your reading quiz. Please keep a copy of this page for your records.</p>
<pre>Reading quiz number: 10
Student number: 1000357071
1. <p>For a string <code>s</code>, why is the attempted access of <code>s[len(s)]<code> always an error?</code></code></p><code><code>

the code s[len(s)] will always give an error because index numbers start from zero and length always start from 1. Therefore, the attempted access of s[len(s)] gives an error because the int received from length is not part of the index number of the string.
2. <p>What is the value of <code>'banana'.count('ana')</code>? Why?</p>
1, because the method .count only includes non-overlapping substrings in the string. 
3. <p>What did you find particularly difficult or confusing about the material you read? If nothing was difficult or confusing, tell us what you found most interesting. Please be as specific as possible: this is meant to help you focus on problematic areas, as well as help me make more meaningful lectures.</p>
The use and result of methods is slightly confusing. Other that that, nothing else was particularly difficult.
