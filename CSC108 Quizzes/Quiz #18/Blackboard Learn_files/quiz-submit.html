1. <p>What is a key? What is a value?</p>

A key and a value are pairs that contain information. For every key, there is a value. A key is a stored location in the memory in a dictionary.
2. <p>What does <code>len</code> do when provided a dictionary? Give an example of using <code>len</code> on a dictionary.</p>
Ex: dictionary = {"Fred":121132, "Akhil": 1231124}
&gt;&gt;&gt; len(dictionary)
2

3. <p>What did you find particularly difficult or confusing about the material you read? If nothing was difficult or confusing, tell us what you found most interesting. Please be as specific as possible: this is meant to help you focus on problematic areas, as well as help me make more meaningful lectures.</p>
Nothing, this is a pretty simple concept.
