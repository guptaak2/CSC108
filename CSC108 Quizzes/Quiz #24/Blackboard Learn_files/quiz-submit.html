<h1>Reading Quiz: Submission Results</h1>
<p>Here is what you have submitted for your reading quiz. Please keep a copy of this page for your records.</p>
<pre>Reading quiz number: 24
Student number: 1000357071
1. <p>Here is the <a href="https://cs.utm.utoronto.ca/~zingarod/108/lecture24/counter.py"><code>Counter class</code></a><code> from the book, with addition of type contracts, better docstrings, and method name <code>getValue</code> changed to <code>get_value</code>. Save the file as <code>counter.py</code>.</code></p><code>

<p>Open <code>counter.py</code> in Idle and run it. Then at the Python shell, type the following as indicated:<br>
</p><pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; from counter import Counter
&gt;&gt;&gt; c1 = Counter()
&gt;&gt;&gt; c2 = Counter()
</pre>
At this point, we have two <code>Counter</code> objects. You can check this:<br>
<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; type(c1)
<class 'counter.counter'="">
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(c2)
<class 'counter.counter'=""> 
</class></class></pre>
You can also use <code>dir(c1)</code> to get a list of methods that you can use on Counters (ignore the ones with underscores).<p></p>

<p>At the shell, what would you type to reset the <code>Counter</code> object referred to by <code>C1</code>?</p>

self.value = 0
2. <p>What would you type now to increment the <code>Counter</code> object referred to by <code>c1</code>?</p>
self.value += 1
3. <p>Did incrementing the <code>Counter</code> referred to by <code>c1</code> increment the other one, two? How can you verify this? What does this tell you about the two objects?</p>
they are 2 distinct objects.
4. <p>What did you find particularly difficult or confusing about the material you read? If nothing was difficult or confusing, tell us what you found most interesting. Please be as specific as possible: this is meant to help you focus on problematic areas, as well as help me make more meaningful lectures.</p>
I didn't do the readings :(
